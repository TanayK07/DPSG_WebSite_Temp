                        <p>The Assam Legislative Assembly
						 came into being on the day of its first sitting on April 7, 1937. The Legislative
						Assembly is empowered to raise Bills which after
						 passing become Acts. The National Register 
						of Citizens (NRC) has been implemented only in the state of Assam which is meant to identify 
						a bona fide citizen and by the order of the Supreme Court of India, it is being currently updated to
						detect Foreign nationals who might have entered the
						State illegally after the midnight of March 24, 197
						1. While NRC does not distinguish migrants on the basis of religion, the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016 
						is designed to grant citizenship to non-Muslim refugees persecuted in neighboring countries. The Bill seeks to grant citizenship to people without valid documents belonging to six religions (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians) from three countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan) after six years of residence in India arriving on or before December 31, 2014.

						
Therefore, discussing the viability of the Citizenship Amendment Act in the Assam Vidhan Sabha will be a highly politically electrifying issue as there will be 
a lot of opposition from some sectors. 
We, with immense pride, are releasing our 4th and one of the most important and
 informative committee of DPSG MUN 2018</p>
