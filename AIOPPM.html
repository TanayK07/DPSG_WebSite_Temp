                        <p>Indian Politics is the zenith of volatile arguments and epitome of robust dealings with the cultural diversity of the Indian State. Post independence,politics was dominated by the Indian National Congess
						 with almost no opposition till the late 70's. Then came 
						the era where the INC started losing its omnipresence in the 
						Indian political scenario, and the nation witnessed the upsurge
						 of political parties who became a part of the formidable opposition.

							Now the time has come, when the 'Lotus' is taking over the Indian states one
							 by one and the INC which once seemed image result for undefeatable, currently finds 
							itself at the helm of affairs but on side opposition.


							This committee sets its objective as foreseeing the future of the
							 current
							 utopian 'Mahagatbandhan', which can be defined as the coming together 
							of the political parties and its personas, with a unanimous motive of uprooting
							 the 'Lotus' and putting an end to the magnanimous reign of Shri Narendra Damodardas Modi.

							The committee will consist of all the political parties except 
							the
							 Bharatiya Janata Party, and the participating members are expected
							 to lay a roadmap while nullifying their age old political and idealistic
							 differences to finally achieve the goal of 'Mahagatbandhan'
							. Presenting to you, the fifth committee of DPSG MUN 2018, All India
							 Opposition Political Parties Meet.
