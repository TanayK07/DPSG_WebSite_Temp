                        <p>The Human Rights Council is an inter-governmental body within the
						United Nations system responsible for strengthening the promotion and
						protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations and make recommendations on them. It has the 
						ability to discuss all thematic human rights issues and situations that require 
						its attention throughout the year. It meets at the UN Office at Geneva.

						


The Council was created by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March 2006 by resolution 60/251. Its first session took place from 19 to 30 June 2006. One year later, the Council adopted its "Institution-building package" to guide its work and set up its procedures and mechanisms.


Among them were the Universal Periodic Review mechanism which serves to assess the 
human rights situations in all United Nations Member States, the Advisory Committee
 which serves as the Council’s “think tank” providing it with expertise and advice 
 on thematic human rights issues and the Complaint Procedure which allows individuals
 and organizations to bring human rights violations to the attention of the Council.
<br>
The Human Rights Council also works with the UN Special Procedures established by 
the former Commission on Human Rights and now assumed by the Council. These are made
 up of special rapporteurs, special representatives, independent experts and working groups that monitor, examine, advise and publicly report on thematic issues or human rights situations in specific countries.

Presenting to you the 8th and the last committee of the DPSG MUN 2018, United Nations Humans Rights Council <p>
